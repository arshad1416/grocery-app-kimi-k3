/**
 * Family invite link generation — the single source of truth for what a
 * shareable/scannable invite contains.
 *
 * An invite must let another device (a) find the relay and (b) join the
 * family. So the payload is always `{ pairingCode, invite }`:
 *   - pairingCode: signed relay address (src/setup/self-host.ts)
 *   - invite:      Ed25519-signed one-time FamilyInviteToken validated by the
 *                  relay's /enroll endpoint (src/identity/family.ts)
 *
 * Both the Settings "Generate QR" button and the per-list "Share" action use
 * this, so they can't drift into incompatible formats (an earlier bug: the
 * list share emitted a bare {listId,familyId} blob the join flow couldn't use).
